KEXParser
=========

A crawler/parser that harvests all of KEXP.org's playlist data from the past twelve years and outputs as either JSON or tab-separated txt file.

The data is interesting and fun to play with if you love KEXP like I do. I used the data to populate a database and I plan on making a web front-end that can be used to query it for all sorts of different interesting stuff.
